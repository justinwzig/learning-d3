## Learning to think in D3.

I have recently undertaken to teach myself D3, which is a bit ambitious because I'm not even confident in my javascript skills yet. This will be arduous, tedious, and, at times, really freakin' confusing, but hopefully I end up better equipped to actualize my datavis fantasies. 

I will be going through the tutorials on available on the D3 wiki https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials. As I go, I will save my files from each "lesson" in a folder, and then push it here. Because the tutorials follow no skill curve and are basically randomly arranged, I'll occasionally reorder the folders in a way that I think makes sense -- starting with the basics, and eventually getting to the good stuff.

As I go, I'm going to try to leave comments that I think someone could learn from -- try to teach someone what I'm learning.

I'll also do my best to link the tutorial I'm learning from (and stealing code from) in each "lesson."

To run each lesson, I use http-server from npm.
