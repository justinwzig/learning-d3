## Learning to think in D3.

I have recently undertaken to teach myself D3, which is a bit ambitious because I'm not even confident in my javascript skills yet. This will be arduous, tedious, and, at times, really freakin' confusing, but hopefully I end up better equipped to actualize my datavis fantasies. 

I will be going through the tutorials on available on the D3 wiki https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials. As I go, I will save my files from each "lesson" in a folder, and then push it here. Because the tutorials follow no skill curve and are basically randomly arranged, I'll occasionally reorder the folders in a way that I think makes sense -- starting with the basics, and eventually getting to the good stuff.

As I go, I'm going to try to leave comments that I think someone could learn from -- try to teach someone what I'm learning. That both helps me think through this stuff, but also means you can learn with me (that sounds weird to write :/). I may eventually record some screencasts to go along with this. 

I'll also do my best to link the tutorial I'm learning from (and stealing code from) in each "lesson."

To run each lesson, I use http-server from npm.
